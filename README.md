## Introduction

As an avid bookworm, I found myself spending too much time hopping between different book sites. To streamline this process, I created Accio Booksâ€”a simple but powerful tool that allows you to search multiple book sites at once.

## Features

- **Consolidated Search**: Search for books across multiple platforms including Goodreads, StoryGraph, Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and more.
- **Dark Mode**: Automatically applies dark mode based on user preference.
- **Mobile Optimized**: Fully responsive and optimized for mobile use.
- **Built-in Localization**: Automatically directs users to their local Amazon URL based on browser language settings, without relying on third-party services.
- **Privacy First**: Minimal data collection, respecting user privacy. While it supports optional affiliate links to help maintain the site, non-affiliate alternate links are always offered.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript**
- **Local Storage** for saving user preferences

## Usage

1. **Search for Books**:
    - Enter the book title (author or ISBN optional) in the search bar.
    - Check the box to open results in a new tab if desired.
    - Click the 'Accio Books!' button to fetch search results from the linked sites.

2. **View Results**:
    - Search links to the book on various sites will be displayed. ISBN# will link directly to Goodreads page, but is less reliable elsewhere.

3. **Dark Mode**:
    - The site will automatically apply dark mode if it was enabled during the last visit.
